Yearbook for BHS 2020 :(

# TODO
- Leon: Login/registration
- Joy: send message
- Ziyong: registration page (image input/upload) => work with Leon
- David: main.html
- Alek: database stuff
- Andrew: Front end and make it look cute

# PLEASE READ! DONT MISS THIS! THE CODE WONT WORK UNTIL YOU DO THIS! VERY IMPORTANT!
- Since Andrew is using react js for the front end, please install node js from the internet. It is crucial!

### brainstorming

account DB
account interface

account personal information -- where you're going to college

## front end big picture:
  - index.html login/registration page
  - main.html shows a list of people you can click on people to view their profile and
  send them a message
  - sendmessage.html (view someone's profile and send them a message optionally)
  - mymessages.html (view messages that you have received)
  - sentmessages.html (view messages that you have written)

## back end big picture:
  - /login
  - /register
  - /send_message
  - /view_my_messages
  - /view_sent_messages
  - /view_profile
  - /edit_profile

later:
  privacy (accept new account requests)
  security: what about passwords
  pictures
  handwriting font


message DB
message sending interface
later: privacy (accept new account requests)

### registration information
